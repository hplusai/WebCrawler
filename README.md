WebCrawler

Description 
==============
Module to parse information from htmls/xml/doc documents
Commands to downloads presents dictionary with XPaths defs.
Please take a look on tests.py module.

Additional info
==============
It's pretty old version from ~ 2010. 
Everything changed since then:
Utils modules set - basically pure functional style programming no OOP,
but seems may be helpful for someone who wants to automate documents processing 
(pretty fast processing in multithread mode and easy to set up rules for parsing)

There is no GUI for now (in plans =) ). 
Probably is best way (for GUI) to create chrome extension 
-- similar to http://webscraper.io/, https://github.com/martinsbalodis/web-scraper-chrome-extension
or maybe webscraper team may use some of my sources - Free Source is the key =)
This version must be rewritten, but i hope to make new one within TreeCat language (replacement for Python).

Installation. Dependencies.
==============

Abilities
==============
parse information from 
htmls/xml/ms words (in Win OS) documents

so on....

To do list:
==============
Rewrite/comment/clean up : code and modules -> prepare to translate into TreeCat Db.
now development is focused on 
  TreeCat : https://github.com/hplusai/TreeCat and
  OpenAssistant : https://github.com/hplusai/openassistant

Support

If you want to support this development, you may donate a cup of coffee. (My "core" works better with this stuff =) )
